## Why Bother With Markdown?

As someone who spends his professional life working between the worlds of academic writing and programming, I often get asked why I prefer and promote the use of markdown as a writing syntax. Usually, the question is framed as something along the lines of "Why would I bother to learn a plain text syntax when Word works just fine for me?" This is a fair question, and as many times as not, I simply say to the one querying, "If you are not interested in learning something new, then don't bother." If anyone wants to keep listening at this point, here are my reasons for encouraging markdown use with my own writing and the teams with which I work. These reasons are not in order of importance and many of them work together.

1. Learning is good.
5. Encourage writing for the web
6. Connect writing to coding as making
2. Simplicity - Focus on Writing not Formatting
3. Readability
4. Portability - publish to many formats using Pandoc
5. Accessibility - plain text writing can be archived more easily and read by any simple text editor
