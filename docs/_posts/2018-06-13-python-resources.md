A list of resources from Stanford Libraries' Center for Interdisciplinary Digital Research (CIDR)

CIDR offers a number of workshops related to digital humanities and computational social sciences through Stanford's academic quarters.

Workshop materials, for python, are stored in a couple of places at the moment, but will hopefully be pulled together into a single space over the next few months.

Older workshop versions:

After we transitioned from using Anaconda for Python in workshops, we switched to using notebooks in Azure Notebooks:

-   [Intro to Python](https://notebooks.azure.com/csbailey/libraries/intro-to-python-spring)
-   [Intro to webscraping with Python](https://notebooks.azure.com/csbailey/libraries/cidr-webscraping)
-   [Data manipuation with Python](https://notebooks.azure.com/versae/libraries/cidr-data-manipulation)
-   [Data visualization with Python](https://notebooks.azure.com/versae/libraries/cidr-data-visualization)
-   [Intro to machine learning with Python](https://notebooks.azure.com/versae/libraries/cidr-intro-to-machine-learning)
-   [Intro to natural language processing with Python](https://notebooks.azure.com/csbailey/libraries/intro-nlp-textblob)
